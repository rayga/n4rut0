Hacking to the system is not limited by one method. An attacker should be creative to create kind of attack.
SO, need information gathering to determine what kind of attack will launch to hack the system. Including one, google hacking based on wordpress site.

This kind of attack used Google Dork to find flaws on wordpress site. You can find many dorks on Google Hacking Database. For example,
with google hacking we can find password from site's database

Google Dork : inurl:wp-config -intext:wp-config '"DB_PASSWORD"' v

and the result :

And then we choose one of the website that appear on google's page. For example, we choose http://charlesdoherty.co.uk/wp-config%20fix.txt,
and we will get display of credential data from the database.

Short explaination about dork that we use :

-inurl:wp-config : this dork is used to find word "wp-config" on url. 

-intext:wp-config '"DB_PASSWORD"': this dork is to find keyword DB_PASSWORD that include on wp-config,and ignore another keyword.
