This time we'll learn about a simple vulnerability that has been found by Anand Prakash.
He used flaw by verification code that facebook send to user phone number. Anand used Burp suite to intercept the browser.

Like we've talked, vulnerability that Anand found is simple. So we can try and learning this attack easily.
The Vulnerability can be found  on request :

POST /recover/as/code/HTTP/1.1
Host: beta.facebook.com

lsd-AVoywo13&n=XXXXX

Writeups :
1. Do request in url https://beta.facebook.com/recover/as/code
2. Next, facebook will display to us to "Reset your password" and enter 6-digit code that facebook send to us by email or our phone.
3. If you have got it, try to enter that code randomly, and before you click continue, you should switch Intercept off (at Burp) become 
intercept on. After that, you can click continue
4. Open Intercept Menu at Proxyt's sub-menu  in Burp, and you will find raw data that result of our request.
5. Right click on raw data and choose Send to Intruder. After that go to Intruder Menu and choose Position sub-menu
6. At the left side, you will find "Add $", "Clear $", "Auto $", and "Refresh" buttons. We choose "Clear $", and highlight variable "n=154000".
After you highlight the n variable, then click "Add $"

7. Go to Payloads sub-menu, in the sub-menu you can be found Payload Sets, Choose file type and click Numbers. 
On the Payload Options [Numbers], fill "From" 154000 and "To" 154898 and "Step" 1. 
8. If you have all of this, click "Start Attack" on left side of Intruder sub-menu. Then you will find pop-up like this :
9. This method is likely Brute-force, because you will be entering code randomly and stop when the code has been found. 
From much effort that we try, to find what successfully request, we must look response of facebook server. 
10. If our request is not yet success, we will fint the response like that :
and when our request is success, we will find like this :

When you've got match response, copy the url location from Burp to your browser. And facebook will ask you to set new password. Enter the new password, and click continue.
