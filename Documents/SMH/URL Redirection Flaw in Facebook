This flaw has been found by Security Expert Dan Melamed. This flaw can redirect us to page that we enter through this url :
http://facebook.com/campaign/landing.php?url=

If we try to enter website address to "url" parameter, we will redirect to our facebook's homepage. For example, try to input http://yahoo.com :
http://facebook.com/campaign/landing.php?url=http://yahoo.com

But, if you try to input string randomly like this :
http://facebook.com/campaign/l.php?url=asdf&h=mAQHgtP_E

"asdf" is random string that we input on "url" parameter. After requesting on browser, facebook generate a "h" variable through Linkshim Facebook (l.php). 
So, to bypass url redirection, you can delete string "http://". If previously we use http://yahoo.com, now we can input only yahoo.com whithout "httt".

http://facebook.com/campaign/landing.php?url=yahoo.com

Finally, facebook will redirect us to page which we enter after "url" parameter.
