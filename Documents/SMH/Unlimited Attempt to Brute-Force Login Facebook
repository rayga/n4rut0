This method still effective but not efficient. Why not efficient, cause we try much string/word as a password. Hence need more time, depend on how much we have the data.

If yout attempt to brute-force facebook directly, your access will limited by facebook. But, you can do that with another way and you will get unlimited access.
Using Burp, we will manipulate the limited access.

Writeups :
1. Open Burp and ensure "Intercept" become "Intercept On". You can check this on Proxy sub-menu
2. After that, login to facebook, dan fill victim's username and randomly password. If you have done, click Login and go to Burp.
3. In Burp, you will find if Burp Intercept the request and get raw data. Right Click on raw data and choose "Semd to Intruder".
4. Move to Intruder menu, click "Clear $" to erase highlight on string. And then click "Add $" on string "pass" that found on raw data.
Why only string "pass" that we highlight ? cause we will only brute-force for password.
5. Choose Payloads sub-menu :
On Payload Options [Simple List], if you want to use password list that exist, you can choose "Load". But if you want to fill password list manually, you can fill the field add directly.
6. If you have been fill the password list, click Start Attack button to begin brute-froce.
7. To find where the right password, you have to look response of every password. If we enter the wrong password, response will give us like this :
but if the password is right, Response will give us unique display, different with wrong password.
