Still on file upload flaw, but this time we exploit the vulnerabilit on plugin "Ultimate-product-catalog". Cause the plugin didn't has file filterisation.
So attacker can upload shell, and attacker can get root access.

And now this step to upload shell :
1. Log in to wordpress site with username and password that you have
2. After that, choose "Custom Fields" and add custom field with file type "file".
3.If you've added the field, then choose "Product" menu and on that manu will display field "file" to upload our shell
4. Upload shell and click Save
5. If you have uploaded succesfully, you can access that shell through this page :
